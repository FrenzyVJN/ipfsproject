# Secure IPFS Drive

[![Deploy on Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Vercel-blue?logo=vercel)](https://secure-ipfs-drive.vercel.app/file-upload)

Secure IPFS Drive is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to securely upload files to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and store the resulting CID (Content Identifier) on the blockchain, specifically the Amoy test network. The application is fully deployed on Vercel, providing a seamless interface for file storage with blockchain-backed verification.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the IPFS protocol for decentralized file storage and the Amoy test network for recording CIDs on the blockchain. By connecting their wallet to the Amoy network, users can securely upload files, obtain a CID from IPFS, and have that CID stored immutably on the blockchain.

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the app [here](https://secure-ipfs-drive.vercel.app/file-upload).

## Features

- **Decentralized File Storage**: Upload files directly to IPFS and obtain a CID for future retrieval.
- **Blockchain-Verified CIDs**: Each file's CID is stored on the Amoy network for security and authenticity.
- **Wallet Integration**: Users must connect their crypto wallet to the Amoy test network to interact with the application.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: For fast and secure access to the dApp.

## Prerequisites

- **Metamask or compatible crypto wallet** connected to the Amoy test network.
- **IPFS API** for uploading and managing files.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-ipfs-drive.git
   cd secure-ipfs-drive
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file and add your IPFS API keys or any required secrets.

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Connect your crypto wallet to the **Amoy test network**.
2. Upload your file through the interface.
3. Once the file is uploaded to IPFS, the returned CID will be stored on the Amoy blockchain for verification.

## Technologies Used

- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage.
- **Amoy Test Network**: For blockchain-based CID storage.
- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform.
